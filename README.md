# hospital-booking-system


Scenario:

A hospital intends to replace its manual booking system with a simple online application. 
Patients should be able to book medical tests such as X-ray, Ultrasound, or Blood Test. The hospital management requires the system to:
  1. Collect accurate booking details.
  2. Prevent double bookings for the same patient, test, date, and time.
  3. Display all bookings for administrative review.
  4. Ensure the system is user-friendly, reliable, and scalable.

User Interface & Usability
  1.Develop a booking form with the following fields:
  Patient Name, 
  Age, Contact Number,
  Test Type, 
  Date, Time, 
  Hospital Name
  
Ensure a clean, professional interface suitable for business use.
Include accessibility features and user guidance messages.


Bookings Management
  Display submitted bookings in a structured table or list.
  Include details such as Patient Name, Test Type, Date, and Hospital Name.
  New bookings should appear instantly.
  Allow filtering or searching by patient name or test type for easier management.
  Patients Table → Stores patient info


Tests Table → Stores available tests


Bookings Table → Stores all bookings and links patients to table




Phase 1: Setup Repository
  -   Initialize Django project, create virtual environment, and install django.
  -   Clone the repository
  -   Create & Activate Virtual Environment
  -   Install Dependencies

Phase 2: Database Architecture
  -  Authentication: Set up User Registration (Patient Registration) to store credentials. (Database)
  -  Database setup:You can use either SQLite (default, easiest).
  -  Make sure DATABASES in settings.py look like this:
                                                        DATABASES = {
                                                        'default': {
                                                            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                                                            'NAME': BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
                                                        }
                                                    }

  - Apply migrations using: python manage.py migrate
  - Environment Variables Setup
  - Create a .env file in the project root: SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
                                            DEBUG=True
                                            DATABASE_NAME=db.sqlite3
                                            EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend

  - - Loading Demo/Test Data
  - The project includes a demo dataset for onboarding and testing booking flows.we can use the seed command: python manage.py seed_data
    
Phase 3: Front-end Interface
  -  User sign up/sign in page
  -  Admin Dashboard
  -  Booking interface

Phase 4: Backend Logic & Validation

Phase 5 : Testing and Deployment
- Demo login credentials for accessing admin dashboard are: - Username: admin
                                                            - Password: password@1234

- Sample Dataset (For Testing): 
- You will find automatically generated demo data after running the seed command:Sample Patients
      Names: John Doe, Alice Kimani, Mary Wanjiku, Peter Otieno
      Emails: autogenerated (example@gmail.com)
      Phone numbers: autogenerated Safaricom numbers

- Sample Bookings

- You can use them to test: Booking creation, Booking editing, Dashboard statistics , Patient search/filter, Admin workflow
- Run the Development Server: python manage.py runserver
